# Content Placeholder

https://thedanitor.github.io/content_placeholder/

This project is from the Day 24 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

I love learning all of these loading animations! What I want to know is how to implement them by necessity. I want to use the loading animation only until the content has loaded. Is there a way to check if the page has actually loaded and then stop the loading animation rather than using arbitrary setTimeout times? I will need to do some research...

### Things Learned

* &nbsp is an HTML entity that means non-breaking space -will not break to a new line
* object-fit is used to set how the contents of img/video should be resized to fit container. Similar options to background-size
